I try to build a Desktop version with nodejs and electron. You find executable
in my dropbox: [Download](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/u18mceddc5u0008/AAD7rxHHM9SdnO_v2iWBdroLa?dl=0)

If you want to run the code inside the `desktop/` folder with plain [node.js](https://nodejs.org)
you have to:

- install nodejs (and npm)
- do `npm i -D electron@latest`
- do `npm start`

If you want to build your own desktop executable:

- install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
- do `npm install`
- do `yarn add electron-builder --dev`
- do `yarn dist`
